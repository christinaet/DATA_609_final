## Textbook Part III:

### The problem

The digestive processes of sheep can highlight the nutrionaly value in varied feeding schedules or varied food prepation. This is esspecially important when raising sheep for commercial purposes. 

### The digestive process

Sheep are a cud-chewing animal which means that unchewed food goes through a series of storage stomachs called the rumen and the reticulum. The process is illustrated below: 

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 2cm]
  \tikzstyle{process} = [rectangle, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=orange!30]
  \tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]
  \node (r) [process, xshift=2cm] {Rumen};
  \node (a) [process, right of=r, xshift=2cm] {Abomasum};
  \node (d) [process, right of=a, xshift=2cm] {Duodemum};
  \node (f) [process, right of=d, xshift=2cm]  {Feces};
  \draw [arrow] (r) -- (a);
  \draw [arrow] (a) -- (d);
  \draw [arrow] (d) -- (f);
\end{tikzpicture}

### The experiment

The digestive process is most observable at the beginning and at the end, we can observer and control what goes in and what comes out. 

### The model 

Suppose that at $t = 0$ a sheep is fed an amount $R$ of food which goes immediately into its rumen. This food will pass gradually from the rumen through the abomasum into the duodenum. At any later time $t$ we shall define:

$r(t)$ = the amount of food still in the rumen;
$a(t)$ = the amount in the abomasum;
$d(t)$ = the amount which by then has arrived in the duodenum.

So $r(0) = R$, $a(0)$ = $d(0)$ = 0, and, for all t>0, 
r(t) + a(t) + d(t) = R.
